## Pros and Cons of TDD
TDD is a software development methodology that involves writing and running tests before you write any app related code. The idea is that the tests will fail at first and you're supposed to write enough code to allow these tests to pass. There are pros and cons to this methodology.

The first pro of this is that because you're writing small tests at a time, it forces your code to be more modular or else it would be hard to test against. The second pro is that it forces good architecture because by writing the tests first, a lot of flaws with regards to architecture will surface earlier in the development process. The third pro is that it makes code easier to maintain and refactor which also allows easier and more efficient collaboration.

The first con of this methodology is tests may be hard to write, especially beyond the unit testing level. The second con is that it slows down development at the early stages of the cycle because most of the time is spent on writing the tests (but it speeds up development later on). The third con is that you might have to mock a lot of things or things that are hard to mock which can become a painful or tedious process. Finally, it's a challenge to learn because it can be intimidating and not easy for anyone to learn at first, especially trying to learn it on your own.
